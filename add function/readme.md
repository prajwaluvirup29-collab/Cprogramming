# README

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates:

* Declaring and using functions
* Passing arguments to functions
* Returning values from functions
* Basic input/output using `scanf` and `printf`

## Program Overview

The program reads two integers from the user, sends them to a function named `addTwoNumbers()`, and displays the computed sum.

## Files Included

* `main.c` — Contains the source code for the addition program.
* `readonly.md` — A formatted reference file containing the program code.

## How to Compile

Use any C compiler such as GCC:

```bash
gcc main.c -o add
```

## How to Run

```bash
./add
```

## Example Output

```
Addition Program
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 20
Sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
```
