# Sum of Even and Odd Index Elements in C

## Description
This program calculates the sum of array elements present at even indices and odd indices separately.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of elements.
2. Read the array elements.
3. If index is even, add element to even sum.
4. If index is odd, add element to odd sum.
5. Display both sums.

## Sample Output
Enter number of elements: 5  
Enter elements: 1 2 3 4 5  
Sum of elements at even indices = 9  
Sum of elements at odd indices = 6

## Applications
- Useful in array index-based analysis
- Helps understand indexing in arrays
