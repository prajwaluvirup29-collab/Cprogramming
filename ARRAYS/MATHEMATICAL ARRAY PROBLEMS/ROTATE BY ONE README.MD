# Rotate Array by One Position (C Program)

## Description
This program demonstrates how to rotate an array by one position to the left
and then to the right using simple looping logic.

## Algorithm
1. Store the first element.
2. Shift all elements one position to the left.
3. Place the stored element at the end.
4. Repeat similar steps for right rotation.

## Input
- Number of elements
- Array elements

## Output
- Array after left rotation by 1
- Array after right rotation by 1

## Applications
- Circular buffers
- Data shifting operations
- Algorithm practice

## Language Used
C Programming Language
