**“Reverse an Array (Without Using Another Array)”** — simple and clear:



# **Reverse an Array (Without Using Another Array)**

## **Objective**

Write a C program to reverse the elements of an array **without using another array**.
This is done by swapping elements from the start and end.

---

## **Logic Used**

1. Read `n` (size of array).
2. Input `n` elements into the array.
3. Use two indices:

   * `i` starting from the beginning
   * `j` starting from the end
4. Swap `a[i]` and `a[j]` while `i < j`.
5. Print the reversed array.



## **Sample Output**

```
Enter size of array: 5
Enter 5 elements:
10 20 30 40 50
Reversed array:
50 40 30 20 10
