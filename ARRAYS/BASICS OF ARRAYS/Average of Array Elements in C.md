# Average of Array Elements in C

## Description
This C program calculates the average value of elements stored in an array. It first takes the number of elements and then reads each value from the user.

## Key Points
- Inputs up to 100 integers
- Computes the total sum of elements
- Calculates the average using `sum / n`
- Displays the result with two decimal points

## Algorithm Steps
1. Input the number of elements.
2. Read each integer into the array.
3. Add every element to a running sum.
4. Compute the average.
5. Print the final average.

## Purpose
Useful for understanding:
- Array traversal
- Loop-based summation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Floating-point calculations in C
