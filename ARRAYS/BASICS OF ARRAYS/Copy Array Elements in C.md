# Copy Array Elements in C

## Overview
This program demonstrates how to copy all elements from one array to another using a simple `for` loop. It takes user input for the number of elements and the values of the first array, then duplicates them into a second array.

## Features
- Reads array size from user
- Accepts elements of the first array
- Copies data into a second array
- Prints the copied array to verify results

## How It Works
1. User enters the array size.
2. The program stores values in `arr1`.
3. A loop transfers each element from `arr1` to `arr2`.
4. The copied array is displayed on the screen.

## Sample Use
Ideal for beginners learning:
- Array handling
