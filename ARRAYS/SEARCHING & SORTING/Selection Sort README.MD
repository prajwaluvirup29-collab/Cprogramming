# Selection Sort in C

## Description
This program implements the Selection Sort algorithm in C.  
Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Select the first element as the minimum.
2. Compare it with remaining elements.
3. Swap it with the smallest element found.
4. Repeat for all elements.

## Input
- Number of elements
- Array elements

## Output
- Sorted array in ascending order

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
