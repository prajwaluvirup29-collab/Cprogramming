# Insertion Sort in C

## Description
This program demonstrates the Insertion Sort algorithm using C.  
Insertion Sort works similar to sorting playing cards in hand by inserting each element into its correct position.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Start from the second element.
2. Compare it with previous elements.
3. Shift elements to the right if they are larger.
4. Insert the element at the correct position.

## Input
- Number of elements
- Array elements

## Output
- Sorted array in ascending order

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
