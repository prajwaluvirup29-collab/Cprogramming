# Bubble Sort in C

## Description
This program sorts elements of an array using the Bubble Sort technique by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Algorithm
1. Read number of elements.
2. Read array elements.
3. Compare adjacent elements.
4. Swap if the first element is greater than the next.
5. Repeat the process until the array is sorted.
6. Display the sorted array.

## Features
- Simple sorting algorithm
- Suitable for small datasets

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

## Language Used
- C Programming
