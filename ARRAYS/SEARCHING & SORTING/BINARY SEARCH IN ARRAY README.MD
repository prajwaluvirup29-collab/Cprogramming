# Binary Search in C

## Description
This program implements binary search to find an element in a sorted array. The search space is reduced to half in every step.

## Algorithm
1. Read the number of elements.
2. Read sorted array elements.
3. Read the element to be searched.
4. Set low and high positions.
5. Find the middle element.
6. Compare middle element with key.
7. Repeat until element is found or search space is empty.

## Note
- The array must be sorted before applying binary search.

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(log n)

## Language Used
- C Programming
