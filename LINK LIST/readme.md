# Linked List in C — Simple Program

## 📌 Overview

This project contains a simple C program that demonstrates the creation and usage of a **singly linked list**. It includes basic operations such as:

* Creating a node
* Inserting nodes at the end
* Displaying the linked list

This is useful for beginners learning data structures in C.

## 📁 Files Included

* **linked_list.c** — Contains the full C program for singly linked list.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Structures (`struct`)
* Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()`
* Pointer manipulation
* Linked list traversal

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the program as `linked_list.c`
2. Compile using:

   ```
   gcc linked_list.c -o linkedlist
   ```
3. Run the program:

   ```
   ./linkedlist
   ```

---

## 📌 Sample Output

```
Linked List: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
```

## 📚 Learning Outcome

You will understand:

* How linked lists work internally
* How nodes are created and linked
* Basic operations on linked lists
